## Overview

SafeSpace is a modern, React and TypeScript-based web application designed to empower users with safety insights, interactive maps, and emergency features. Built with Vite for rapid development and optimized performance, it provides a scalable foundation for safety-focused platforms.

> **Note:**  
> This project is a demo of the concept. Most features, including safety score generation, do not use real-time parameters. Instead, location scores are generated using randomly simulated parameters, which are then passed through a formula derived from a pre-trained AI model. The AI model was trained separately on relevant safety data, and its learned weights are used to compute the safety score for each location.

## Why SafeSpace?

This project aims to deliver a comprehensive safety platform with seamless user experience and robust features. The core features include:

- **🎯 Map & Safety Score:**  
  Interactive maps display neighborhood safety metrics to inform user decisions.  
  *Scores are calculated using the output weights of a separately trained AI model, based on parameters (randomly generated for demo purposes) fed into the model's formula.*

- **🚨 Emergency Alerts:**  
  Quick SOS functionality transmits simulated real-time geolocation during emergencies.

- **💡 Self-Defense Resources:**  
  Educational components offer techniques and safety tips to empower users.

- **⚙️ Modular Architecture:**  
  Configurable setup supporting React, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and TypeScript for maintainability.

- **🔬 Testing & Optimization:**  
  Built-in testing and build configurations ensure reliability and performance.

## Disclaimer

SafeSpace is a proof-of-concept demo. The safety scores and alerts are not based on live data. All score calculations use randomly generated parameters processed by a formula derived from a pre-trained AI model, and do not reflect real-world conditions.
